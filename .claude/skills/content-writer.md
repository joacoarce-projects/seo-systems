# Content Writer (System 2, interactive)

Write one blog post for the user's site, walking them through the 5-step workflow with approval checkpoints.

## When to invoke

The user says any of:
- "write a post" / "write the next one"
- "draft a blog post"
- "let's write something about X"
- "content writer" / "system 2"
- "pick a post from the queue and write it"

If the user says something like "write 3 posts" or "ship the whole queue", politely refuse and explain: this is one post per invocation by design, because every post needs human-in-the-loop on the brief, sources, and outline. Offer to run again after this one ships.

## What you do (high level)

You run the same 5-step workflow as the scheduled `content-writer` agent, in **interactive mode**: you ask the user to pick from the queue, ask about topic-specific experience, present sources for approval, present the outline for approval, draft, self-review, save, mark the queue, and trigger the dashboard re-render.

The full prompt with all rules (Layer 0 doctrina es-CL + AEO, arquetipos, Content Capsule format, citation anchor rules, Three Kings, em-dash ban, fan-out coverage tracking, mode-aware behaviour) lives at:

```
seo-systems/prompts/content-writer.md
```

**Read that prompt first.** It is the source of truth. This skill is the on-demand entry point. Do not duplicate its rules here.

## Project root

El working directory es `proyectos/L6-seo/`. Desde ahí:

- Motor, prompts y scripts: `seo-systems/`
- Context / state / output del cliente: `clientes/<slug>/`
- Doctrina (Layer 0): `prompts-es-cl/` y `docs/` — cuelgan de `L6-seo/`, NO de `seo-systems/`

Los paths de Layer 0 que cita el prompt son relativos a `L6-seo/`. Si estás parado en `seo-systems/`, no resuelven: volvé a `L6-seo/` o usá paths absolutos.

## Doctrina obligatoria (Layer 0)

Antes de los 8 archivos de `context/`, leé:

| Doc | Qué manda |
|---|---|
| `prompts-es-cl/01-style-guide-base.md` | Vocabulario chileno, palabras AI prohibidas, burstiness, estructura, longitudes |
| `prompts-es-cl/03-master-draft-prompt.md` | Prompt de redacción canónico (Track 1 nueva pieza / Track 2 optimización) |
| `prompts-es-cl/02-editorial-review-checklist.md` | Los 12 checks pre-publicación. **Gate humano, no lo cerrás vos** |
| `docs/11-aeo-evidencia-2026.md` §2.1-2.2 | 4 gatekeepers grado A + 7 diferenciadores secundarios |
| `docs/07-onpage-money-page-checklist.md` | Solo money page contenido-aeo: floor 950 + cifra en el title + fecha visible |
| `docs/09-local-service-playbook.md` | Solo money page servicio local: GBP #1, **sin floor 950** |

Detectá el arquetipo (`spoke` / `money-aeo` / `money-local`) en el Step 1 y declaralo. De eso depende qué doc manda.

## How interactive mode differs from auto-pilot

In this skill, you are interactive. Specifically:

- **Step 1 brief**: list the top 3 queued items from `state/content-queue.json` and ask the user to pick. Then ASK them about topic-specific experience. Wait for their answer before continuing.
- **Step 2 research**: present the 8-12 sources you found as a numbered list. Wait for the user to approve, reject, or swap before continuing.
- **Step 3 outline**: present the full outline (title, H2/H3, capsule marks, internal-link picks, experience callouts, business-fact callouts) and wait for approval.
- **Step 4 draft**: just write it. Don't ask for permission to draft.
- **Step 5 review**: run the self-checklist, fix any failures, then show the user the report.
- **Step 6 save and hand off**: write the markdown, update the queue, attempt publish, regenerate dashboard, print a summary with the file path.

Do not fall back to auto-pilot inside this skill. If the user is annoyed by the approval steps and tells you to "just write it", that's their call to skip approvals - but still walk through the steps in order, showing your work.

## Reading the 8 context files

Same rule as the prompt: read Layer 0 first, luego los 8 archivos de `context/`, antes de cualquier otra cosa. If any are missing, stop and tell the user to run the `context-bootstrapper` skill first. Do not attempt to draft a post against an incomplete context folder.

## When the queue is empty

If `pick-next-queue-item.py` returns `NO_QUEUED_ITEMS` (exit 2) and the user did not name a different topic, tell them:

```
The content queue is empty. Run the keyword-researcher skill to find a fresh
seed and fan it out, then come back here.
```

Offer to invoke the `keyword-researcher` skill yourself if they want, but only if they confirm.

## Cost expectation

A typical run is 25 to 40 minutes wall-clock (most of that is you waiting for the user) and costs about $0.30 to $0.50 in DataForSEO + Claude API combined.

## Hard rules

- **Read the full prompt at `seo-systems/prompts/content-writer.md` before any action.** Do not skim. Re-read it on every invocation.
- **Leé Layer 0 antes de escribir.** `prompts-es-cl/` y `docs/07|09|11` mandan sobre lo heredado del fork.
- One post per invocation.
- Nunca declares la pieza validada ni la publiques live con `editorial_review: pending` sin OK explícito de Joaquín.
- Never auto-publish before writing to `output/posts/`. The local markdown file is the canonical artifact.
- Never fabricate a citation, a customer story, a stat, or a business fact. If you cannot back it up, drop it or flag `[TK: confirm]`.
- Never edit `state/keyword-bank.json` (that's System 1's territory).
- Update `state/content-queue.json` only via `scripts/mark-queue-item.py`.
- Never use em dashes anywhere.
